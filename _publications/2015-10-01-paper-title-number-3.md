In the context of the strategy of rejuvenating China through science and education and the deepening of globalization, this paper uses the panel data of 31 provincial administrative regions in China from 2003 to 2020 to study the impact of China's higher education input on China's overseas direct investment. The results show that higher education investment can significantly promote the development of China's overseas direct investment, and the regression results pass the endogeneity test and robustness test. Heterogeneity test shows that higher education investment has a higher promoting effect in central and western China and 2012-2020 compared with eastern China. In addition, this paper constructs a panel threshold regression model to identify the impact of higher education input on overseas direct investment at different stages of human capital accumulation. Threshold effect in human capital as a threshold effect variable regression analysis, the results show that the higher education investment, under different levels of human capital can significantly promote the development of foreign direct investment in China, but the role will have declined with the increase of human capital, the reason may be that the increase of human capital, higher education as provide the main approaches of human capital, The marginal contribution to overseas direct investment will gradually decline. The policy suggestion of this paper is that China should increase investment in higher education to promote human capital accumulation and overseas direct investment.
